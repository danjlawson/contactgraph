## contactgraph overview

A Contact Graph is a putative history of populations which can be applied to numerous data types.

[testmix.R](testmix.R) contains a simple simulated example of how to use the code. The functions are in [mixfunctions.R](mixfunction.R).

Currently the example shows a problematic case for which multiple graphs lead to the same prediction. The problem can be seen as one of over-interpretation (events need not be real) or under-specification (additional context is needed). The package ultimately will address these sorts of problems by combining additional data sources that describe different time-depths.
